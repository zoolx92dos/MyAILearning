  - Stopwords
  - Tokens (Words/Sentence)

Components of NLP (NLU, NLG, NL)

NLU
1. Lexical Ambiguity (word level)
2. Syntactical Ambiguity (sentence level)
3. Referential Ambiguity 

NLG
1. Text Planning
2. Sentence Planning
3. Text Realization

Levels/Phases of NLP
1. Lexical Analysis (lexicon/words)
2. Syntactic Analysus (Relationship among words)
3. Semantic Analysis (Meaningfulness)
4. Disclosure Integration
5. Pragmatic Analysis

Text Processing
1. Tokenization (Tokens)
2. Stemming 
3. Lemmatization
4. POS Tagging
5. Stopword Removal

Applications
1. Speech Recognition
2. Sentiment Analysis
3. Machine Translation
4. Text Summarization
5. Text Classification

Challenges in NLP
1. Language Difference
2. Training Data
3. Ambiguities
4. Misspellings
5. Multiple Intentions
6. Uncertainity

Language Syntax and Semantics
1. Morphological Analysis
  - Morphemes (Base + Affixes) - Prefix, Base/Root/Stem, Suffix
  - Affixes (prefixes, suffixes, infixes)
2. Inflection
3. Derivation
4. Compounding - Combination of multiple word stems
5. Inflectional Morphology
6. Derivational Morphology
  - Deals with derivational morphemes
  - use of prefix or suffix allowed
  - change in class/category
7. Finite State Morphological Parsing
8. Stem Changes (regular and irregular words)

Syntactic Analysis
1. Syntax (Grammatical Structure)
2. Analyzing NL with the rules of a given grammar
3. Grammatical Rules applied on group of words

Parser
1. Used to implement parsing
2. o/p is parse tree
3. it reports syntax error

Types of Parsing
1. Top-down (start symbol -> input symbol) (expansion)
2. Bottom-up (input symbol -> start symbol) (compression)

Types of Derivation
1. Left most
2. Right most

Passing Algorithm CYK (Cocke–Younger–Kasami) algorithm
  - Grammaer: CFG
  - Form: Chomsky Normal Form

Semantic Analysis
- Meaning of text
1. Individual words (lexical semantics)
2. Combination of words (compositional semantics)

Elements of semantic analysis
1. Hyponymy
2. Homonymy
3. Synonymy
4. Antonymy
5. Polysemy
6. Meronoymy

Tasks in Semantic Analysis
1. WSD (Word Sense Disambiguation) - Interpreting the meaning of a word based upon the context in a text

Relationship Extraction
Entity -> Semantic Analysis -> NLP -> AI

Basic Building block of semantic system
1. Entity - A particular unit/individual
2. Concept - Generalization of Entities
3. Relations - Between entity and a concept
4. Predicate - represents verb structure

Approaches to meaning representation
1. FOPL (First Order Predicate Logic)
2. Quantifiers
3. Semantic Nets (Graphical Depction of objects and their relationships)

Language Modelling
1. Determing the probability of a given sequence of words in a text/sentence based on previous words
2. Develop probabilistic models that can predict the next word in sequence (N-gram language model)

Conditional Probability Distribution
P(next word | previous word)
Unigram, Bigram, Trigram

Bag of Words

Word2vec

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Topic Modelling - Discover topic/main idea (unsupervised)
1. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
2. Latent Semantic Analysis
3. SVD (Decomposing a matrix into a product of 3 matrices)
4. Topic Encoded Data

IR Models

Named Entity Recognition

Information Retreival
1. Indexing
  - Tokenization
  - Stemming
  - Techniques (Boolean Model, Vector Space Model)
2. Matching
  - Measure of similarity between two text

Sentiment Analysis
