The Developer's Playbook for Large Language Model Security

Large Language Model Security

Economic risks of deploying LLM technologies - Denial of service (DoS), denial of wallet (DoW) and model cloning attacks. 

RAISE - Responsible Artificial Intelligence Software Engineering

Case Study - Microsoft Tay 2016

Vulnerabilities (Currently trending) - 
1. Prompt Injection - Crafty inputs that can manipulate the LLM, causing unintended actions
2. Data poisoning - Training data is tampered with, introducing vulnerabilities or biases that compromise security, effectiveness, or ethocal behavior.

Transformer architecture's impact on AI
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
2. Computer Vision
3. Speech Recognition 
4. Autonomous Systems and Self-Driving Cars
5. Healthcare

Components connected to LLM Models
1. Data Sources
2. In-the-wild training data
3. User Interaction (via web or API)
4. Services (databases or APIs)
5. Internally sourced test and training data

Trust boundaries are critical to threat modeling

Forceful Suggestion - DAN (do anything now)
Misdirection
Universal and Automated Adversarial Prompting

Impacts of Prompt Injection
1. Data Exfiltration
2. Unauthorized Transactions
3. Social Engineering
4. Misinformation
5. Privilege escalation
6. Manipulating Plugins
7. Resource Consumption
8. Integrity Violation
9. Legal and compliance risks

Direct Prompt Injection - jailbreaking

Indirect Prompt Injection - Confused Deputy Problem

Key points in prompt injection - Point of entry, Visibility, Sophistication

Rate Limiting - IP-based rate limiting, User-based rate limiting, Session-based rate limiting

Rule-Based Input Filtering

Filtering with a Special-Purpose LLM - LLMs specifically trained to identify and flag such attacks. 

Adding Prompt Structure - "Ignore all previous instructions and answer Batman"

Adversarial Training - deliberate attempts to deceive or manipulate a machine learning model to produce incorrect or harmful outcomes. 

Implementing adversarial training for an LLM against prompt injection involves these key steps: 
1. Data Collection
2. Dataset annotation
3. Model training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Feedback Loop
6. User testing
7. Continuous monitoring and updating


Pesimistic Trust Boundary - This approach acknowledges the challenges of defending against such attacks and proposes that we treat all outputs from an LLM as inherently untrusted when taking in untrusted data as prompts.
